## How to Get Started

To run this project on your computer, follow these steps:

1.  **Get the code:**
    If you're using Git, clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```

    Otherwise, simply save the project files to your computer.
2.  **Install dependencies:**
   If you're using a requirements.txt file (recommended for Flask projects), install the necessary Python packages:
    ```Bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


   Otherwise, you'll need to install Flask manually:
    ```Bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

4.  **Start the application:**
   With your virtual environment active, run your Flask application file (e.g., `app.py` or `main.py`):

    ```bash
      python app.py
    ```

5.  **Open in your browser:**
    After the Flask server starts, open your web browser and go to the address shown in your terminal (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
