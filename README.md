## Technologies Used

  * **HTML:** This provides the basic structure for the web page.
  * **CSS:** This handles the look and layout of the app.
  * **JavaScript:** This powers the calculator's functions and how it interacts with users.
  * **Flask:** This is a Python framework used for the server part of the application.
  * **Jinja:** This helps in creating dynamic HTML pages using Python.
  * **uv:** A modern, fast tool for managing Python virtual environments and packages. The virtual environment for this project is already included in the repository.

## How to Get Started

To run this project on your computer, follow these steps:

1.  **Get the code:**
    If you're using Git, clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```

    Otherwise, simply save the project files to your computer.

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    Since the virtual environment (`.venv`) is already included, you just need to activate it:

      * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
      * On Windows (PowerShell):
        ```bash
        . .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
      * On Windows (Command Prompt):
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```

    Once activated, your terminal prompt should change (often showing `(.venv)`), indicating you're in the right environment.

3.  **Start the application:**
    With your virtual environment active, run your Flask application file (e.g., `app.py` or `main.py`):

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4.  **Open in your browser:**
    After the Flask server starts, open your web browser and go to the address shown in your terminal (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
